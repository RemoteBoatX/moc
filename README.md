# Maritime Operating Center (MOC) environment

The repository contains code for the shore-side of the [VRGP
specification](https://github.com/aboamare/vrgp-specifications/).
It implements both a backend (to communicate with the vessel-side) and a
frontend (for easy visualization of the data received from the boat).
